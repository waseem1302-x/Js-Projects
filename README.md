# 🧠 JavaScript Mini Projects – My Intro to JS

This repository contains my very first JavaScript projects—created during my **introductory days learning JS**, before I moved into Python and backend development. These small exercises helped me understand the **core concepts of JavaScript** like variables, functions, conditionals, and the DOM.

Though simple, they are a part of my growth as a developer and reflect my curiosity and commitment to learning.

## 📚 My Learning Story

> These were my first hands-on experiences with JavaScript during the early days of my coding journey. At the time, I was experimenting with **front-end development**, learning how JavaScript interacts with HTML and builds interactivity.  
> Later, I transitioned into backend development and **focused more on Python**, especially after receiving a **fully funded scholarship to study Computer Science in Malaysia**.  
>  
> These projects remain a special reminder of where my journey began and how much I’ve grown since then.
